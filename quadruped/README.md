# minitaur

This is a experimental repository playing with the minitaur within pybullet.

Hopefully we can learn something about locomotion controlling and get familiar with legged robots.

The code is based on [Erwin Coumans's work](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/examples/pybullet/gym/pybullet_envs/bullet/minitaur.py).
